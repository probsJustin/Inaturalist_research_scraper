# INaturalist research scrapper project
Project status: work in progress

Project that scrapes Inaturalist website for specific information and then processes that information into images that can be identified by a larger audience/group in the context of a research project that identifies if climate change has an effect on bloom/reproductive cycles of plants. etc.



### Index:
 - testing_scratch_book: scripts that I don't need/tested things in.
